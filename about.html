                <h4>&emsp;Justin Alan Kossow is a department lead at Park National Bank in Ohio. He is married to Brandy Kossow. Together they have visited       fourteen countries. Their most fulfilling trip was when they hiked the Classic Inca Trail to visit the Machu Picchu. This arduous four day journey was plagued by mosquitoes and heavy rainfall but the stunning views and success after many months of training was worth it. However, their favorite trip was when they rented a camper van and spent a week travelling across Iceland. It was a magical journey reminiscent of the wonders of Skyrim and they haven’t seen anything that matches Iceland’s crystal blue waters.<br>&emsp;When not running countless accounts through his head, Justin enjoys spending his Wednesday evenings participating in “Pump and Play”. During this weekly ritual, his friends tear up the gym before settling in for a round of board games. As lifelong members of the Whitehouse Board Gaming Club they have access to a wide range of modern and classic board games to rent.<br>&emsp;In addition, Justin enjoys backpacking through many of Ohio’s national parks. He and Brandy first started backpacking in preparation for their Machu Picchu trip and have since enjoyed smaller adventures within the States. He also participates regularly in the Warrior Dash and similar events that take a 5k / 10k race and add in many obstacles. His favorite part is the beer at the end.<br>&emsp; Justin hopes to continue advancing his career as an Accountant and retire early to travel with his wife.
